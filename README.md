# ProductionManagement
The beginnings of my Manufacturing Production Management WebApp

This Django Application will track the progress of each "production run" from machining, assembly, packaging and heat shrinking. These are the production steps for my current company and most of the field names are geared towards this end, but they could easily be renamed to suit your purposes.

Since I'm doing this in my off time, I'm opening this up to the public under the GNU-3.0 license. See license file for more details and legal mumbo-jumbo.
